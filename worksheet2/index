1. Display the use of any 5 inbuilt string functions.
2. Write a program to reverse a string without using any inbuilt functions.
3. Check if a string is a palindrome
4. Write a program for the following: (string is reversed from half)
INPUT: abcdefgh

5. Find the number of occurrences of a word in a sentence.

6. Find the length of the longest word in a sentence

8. Write a function that finds the first non-repeated character in a string. The
function should return the first character that does not repeat anywhere else in
the string.

9. Write a function that takes two strings as input and determines if they are
anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging
the letters of another word or phrase. The function should return True if the
strings are anagrams and False otherwise.
Sample Input:
String 1: "listen"
String 2: "silent"
Sample Output: True
10. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the most frequent
character(s) in the string. If there are multiple characters with the same maximum
frequency, return all of them in a list. The order of characters in the list does not
matter.
Sample Input: "abcaabbccc"
Sample Output: ['c']
